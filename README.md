# password-generator

The task involved needed to create a solution to enable a user to generate passwords using a random selection of numbers, letters and special characters.
To allow the user to succesfully use this; I have included
 -Alerts and prompts for the user to guide through the generating process
 -Variables with different arrays which would fulfill the generator password brief
 Used conditional if/if else statements to ensure the password fit the specified conditions.
